VPpubsub.sub('foo.bar', function (data, evnt, $$sub) {
    console.log(data, evnt, $$sub);
}, window);
//subscribe to foo.bar and execute the subscriber in the window scope
VPpubsub.sub('foo.bar', function (data, evnt, $$sub) {
    console.log(data, evnt, $$sub);
}, null, window);
//subscribe to all events
